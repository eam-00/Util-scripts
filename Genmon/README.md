# Genmon Scripts

A couple of bash scripts I use to get information on the XFCE Panel, using the [Genmon Plugin](https://docs.xfce.org/panel-plugins/xfce4-genmon-plugin).

**genMon-time.sh**

![genMon-time.sh on the XFCE Panel](Pics/genMon-time.sh.png)

Prints the local time, using a specific format: "17:23". Also, disables any form of tool tip when mouse over, as I find those really annoying.
