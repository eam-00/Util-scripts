# Util-scripts

_A couple of miscelaneous and utilitarian Linux server scripts._

## get-sysinfo.sh

Get all sorts of information on a Linux box (Linux, kernel, CPU, RAM, Network, etc, etc.) and save that info onto a log file.

## reboot-email.sh

Send an email when a server is rebooted.

## check-updates.sh

Issues an apt-get update a day and sends an email with the report

## setup-server.sh

This one sets things up on a server, makes a copy of the original files and then replaces those with pre-edited config files. A work in progress.
